#TORS TORS maintains tour information and provides reservation
facilities for the people who wish to travel on tours via the Internet. The system allows users
to view information about the tours available and make a reservation on a tour without asking
the employees at the agency. Using the system, a user can cancel an existing reservation that
the user made.
